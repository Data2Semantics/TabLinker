- Make sure you have an excel file where the cells are configured using the proper D2S styles. An example of such a file is found in the marked/ folder. Each cell has a D2S style. This style is used by the python script to recognize the type of content (e.g. whether the cell contains data, a header, a property, etc etc)
- Run the tablinker script
- Should there be any problems, first take a look at the config file and check whether all config settings are properly set
